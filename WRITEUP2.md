# Natural Permutations

A permutation is a mapping which reorders elements of a set. The set can be finite, or infinite. There are many "simple" permutations on infinite sets â€” for example, the identity permutation simply maps an element to itself (no reordering). This writeup takes up the challenge of defining a non-simple permutation on the natural numbers. An encoding is defined as an invertible mapping from the natural onto a subspace of _canonical binary strings_. The approach taken here is to find two different encodings $benc$ and $penc$; the permutation is defined by composing one encoding with the inverse of the other. After walking through the setup, some limited exploration and analysis is presented.

# Permutations

```math
P = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & \rarrow & 2 \\
        2 & \rarrow & 4 \\
        3 & \rarrow & 5 \\
        4 & \rarrow & 1 \\
        5 & \rarrow & 3 \\
        6 & \rarrow & 6 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
```
